Price is fixed. No negotiation, so do not apply hoping to negotiate a higher price. I have quite a few other jobs that are similar, so I would prefer someone who I can continue working with in the future.

the discord bot should monitor a certain channel and look for the words "calls" or "puts" and if the line contains them format them if the right parameters are there and then repost it to another channel

-it should be able to set date in code. ie. 9/24

2 date parameters (I want to be able to set them manually in the code):
DATE1:
DATE2:

-if line contains the word "SPY" or "QQQ", uses DATE2, otherwise DATE1
